# Explore Narrowing and Widening types!

1. Explore `any`, `unknown` and `never`. How do they compare to each other? Are they consistent? Maybe try using a them with a few Type Assertions (`as`). Does it do what you expect?

2. We mostly explored narrowing via Type Guards and Assertion guards, but there are tonnes of other ways to narrow types in TypeScript! Try to use `typeof`, `===` and `in` to narrow some types! Also have a go at writing a type guard or an assertion guard if you want!
